# Design and Fabrication of a C–D Nozzle for Wind Tunnel Application

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involved the **design, fabrication, and testing of a supersonic convergent–divergent (C–D) nozzle** (Mach 2.8) for application in a blow-down type supersonic wind tunnel.  
The work integrated **analytical design (Method of Characteristics)**, **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)**, and **experimental validation**.

## 🛠️ Methods
- **Nozzle Design (Mach 2.8)**  
  - Implemented the **Method of Characteristics (MOC)** in **MATLAB** to generate the nozzle contour.  
  - Ensured manufacturability with integrated pressure ports for data acquisition.  

- **Fabrication**  
  - Manufactured the nozzle using CNC machining.  
  - Integrated static pressure ports along the nozzle for calibration and testing.  

- **Wind Tunnel Testing**  
  - Installed the nozzle in the supersonic wind tunnel facility at MSRUAS.  
  - Conducted tests with Schlieren visualization and static pressure measurements.  

- **CFD Validation**  
  - Simulated nozzle flow using **ANSYS Fluent** with structured meshes.  
  - Compared Mach number distribution and shock structures with experimental results.  

## 📊 Results
- Successfully generated a supersonic contour (target Mach = 2.8).  
- Experimental tests confirmed supersonic flow with shock visualization via Schlieren setup.  
- CFD results agreed qualitatively with experimental trends, while discrepancies were attributed to nozzle surface roughness and condensation effects.  
- Identified and quantified sources of error between **theoretical, experimental, and CFD** results.
